# 2026-01-10 — Session log

## Summary

- Reviewed the repo to recover “unlogged” changes since the last progress note.
- Homepage updates (TTS-focused hero + product UI mockup) were merged in commit `c878c9d`.
- Verified `pnpm build` succeeds on current `main`.

## What changed since the last log (2026-01-08)

- Homepage hero copy now focuses on Text-to-Speech (voice cloning still “coming soon”).
- Added a “Product UI Mockup” section on the homepage that renders a static screenshot.
- Moved hero highlight strings into i18n dictionaries and updated TS types.
