# 2026-01-11_2113 — Migrate openfmlab changes + Pricing “积分加油站” + Membership card

## What changed

- Homepage image gap fix: “Fast Processing” section image now fully fills the card (removed inner `w-3/4 h-[90%]` wrapper, switched to `absolute inset-0` cover).
- openfmlab migration:
  - Identified root cause of “迁移不过来”: unresolved git conflict markers (`<<<<<<< / ======= / >>>>>>>`) in `openfmlab` pages + locale JSON.
  - Ported **HEAD/RTVox** versions of `pricing/integrations/contact/status/privacy/terms/cookies` into `openfmvideo`:
    - Updated `src/app/[locale]/*/page.tsx` metadata suffixes to `RTVox`.
    - Updated `src/i18n/locales/*.json` `pages.*` content for those pages across all locales.
    - Fixed typo `RTXox` → `RTVox` across locale JSON.
  - Replaced `src/app/[locale]/integrations/page.tsx` with the custom integrations UI variant (no conflict markers).
- Pricing / membership:
  - Restored a third pricing card plan `id: "points"` (“积分加油站” / “Credits Station” / “ポイント補給所”) in `src/lib/pricing/i18n-config.ts`.
  - Pricing UI now renders 3 cards; the `points` CTA is disabled (no redirect/payment yet).
  - Membership page now shows an extra “积分加油站” card (disabled, localized “Coming soon/即将上线”).

## Verification

- `pnpm build` passes.

## Notes / Next

- Payments are still subscription-only; `points` top-up checkout is intentionally not implemented yet.
- There is still remaining ShipBase copy in other areas (e.g. root `metadata`, some homepage strings, login/signup, etc.) if you want a full SEO/rebrand sweep.
