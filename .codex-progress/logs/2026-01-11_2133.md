# 2026-01-11_2133 — Dashboard/Membership token UX + skeletons + admin blogs locale routes

## What changed

- Podcast MVP avatars:
  - `/podcast-mvp` no longer reuses the homepage人物图片; voice cards use per-voice generated avatars (with fallback).
- Dashboard (customer-facing):
  - Removed “revenue/orders” template stats and replaced with token-centric data:
    - token balance (`/api/tokens`)
    - plan status (`/api/membership/status`)
    - total generations (`/api/tts/history`, gracefully handles history/DB unavailable)
  - Dashboard no longer shows the footer.
  - Added skeleton loading states while dashboard data loads.
- Membership (customer-facing):
  - Reworked to show token/usage and plan state, not API/project-style metrics.
  - Billing history now shows skeletons while loading.
- Skeleton loading:
  - Added App Router `loading.tsx` skeletons for `profile`, `membership`, `orders`, `blogs`, and blog detail.
  - Improved component-level skeletons for orders/blogs pages.
- Admin blogs i18n + routing:
  - Fixed language switching for `/admin/blogs` by adding locale-prefixed routes:
    - `/{locale}/admin/blogs`, `/{locale}/admin/blogs/new`, `/{locale}/admin/blogs/[id]/edit`
  - Ensured admin navigation keeps the current locale (no jumping back to `/admin/...`).
  - Removed remaining hardcoded English strings in admin blog list/editor (loading/confirm/back/saving/placeholders).
- Build stability:
  - `package.json` build uses `next build --webpack` (Turbopack was crashing during build).

## Verification

- `pnpm build` passes.
