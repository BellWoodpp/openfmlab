# 2026-01-11_2114 — Homepage i18n fixes + remove Profile action buttons

## What changed

- Profile page: removed the non-functional action buttons (“Edit Profile / Change Password”).
- Homepage: replaced hardcoded Hero/sections copy with `home.*` i18n fields so text follows locale switching:
  - Badge label (“VOICE MAGICIAN” / “语音魔法师” / etc.)
  - Hero title (supports newline split) + tagline + description
  - Product mockup title/subtitle
  - “Text to Speech” feature section + “Security” section copy + CTA labels
- TTS UI mockup: localized UI chrome strings (titles, “Public”, “Language”, “Generate”, character/token count template, etc.) via `HomeDictionary`.
- Locale home metadata: normalized `home.heroTitle` newlines into spaces for the `<title>`.

## Notes

- Attempted to swap a homepage image asset and make it fill the container; that change was reverted.

## Verification

- `pnpm build` passes.
