# 2026-01-12_2033 — Site-wide ShipBase/SEO sweep + static-friendly rendering

## What changed

- Removed remaining `ShipBase/Shipbase` branding across the app (pages, i18n, auth config).
- SEO/metadata cleanup:
  - Root metadata now uses `siteConfig` and `title.template` (`src/app/layout.tsx`).
  - Locale pages no longer manually append “- RTVox/— RTVox” to titles (avoids double-brand titles).
  - Added `robots: { index:false, follow:false }` to non-public pages (dashboard/profile/membership/orders/points/payment flows + admin).
  - `robots.txt` disallow now also covers locale-prefixed private routes (e.g. `/zh/dashboard`).
- Vercel free-tier optimization:
  - Removed request-header based locale detection in the root layout (it was forcing many routes to `ƒ`).
  - Public marketing pages return to `○/●` where possible; auth/DB/session pages remain dynamic.
- Routing/i18n:
  - Added root `middleware.ts` to keep default locale URLs clean (`/en/...` → `/...`) and rewrite missing-locale paths to default-locale routes.
  - Deleted `src/proxy.ts` (replaced by root middleware).
- Cleanup:
  - Removed stray placeholder route `src/app/login/page.tsx`.
  - Deleted `src/app/podcast-mvp.backup/page.tsx`.
  - Removed the refund terms “Tip: this is a summary...” line from customer UI (kept empty tips + conditional rendering).

## Notes / tradeoffs

- `<html lang>` is currently fixed to the default locale (`en`) to keep public pages static-friendly. Content is still localized by route.

## Verification

- `pnpm build` passes.
