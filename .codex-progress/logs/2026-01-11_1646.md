# 2026-01-11_1646 — RTVox rebrand polish + Help/Docs/Pricing updates

## What changed

- Help page reworked for RTVox (EN/ZH/JA) and internal links localized; “Popular Articles” cards are now clickable.
- Fixed a JSON syntax error in `src/i18n/locales/en.json` that broke parsing/build.
- Home locale page metadata updated to RTVox (`src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`).
- Home top copy across locales updated (`home.heroTitle`, `home.heroDescription`, `home.ctaPrimary`) for RTVox positioning.

## Previously completed (recent batch)

- Homepage “Text to Speech” input UI:
  - Localized intro + localized placeholder for EN/ZH/JA.
  - Clearing text then clicking any voice re-inserts the localized default intro text.
  - Removed “Upload File” from demo.
  - Added purple `GENERATE` button linking to `/podcast-mvp`.
  - Voice preview prefers local sample MP3s (fallback to `speechSynthesis`).
- Podcast MVP:
  - Tone selector has a `?` tooltip dialog describing tone types.
  - Voice avatars match homepage avatars; avatar circle size increased.
- Pricing:
  - Removed “One-time Payment”; only monthly/yearly.
  - Removed Enterprise plan; only Free + Professional.
  - Free CTA text in EN: “Currently using”.
  - Payments API now expects `{ product_id, period }` and always creates subscription orders; `CREEM_PRODUCTS` must include keys like `professional:monthly` / `professional:yearly`.
- Docs and Help content rewritten for RTVox + Google Text-to-Speech usage guidance (EN/ZH/JA).
- Voice cloning UI hidden unless `NEXT_PUBLIC_VOICE_CLONING_ENABLED=1`.

## Verification

- `pnpm build` passes.

## Notes / Next

- Many other locales/pages still contain ShipBase boilerplate copy (Integrations/Status/Terms/Privacy/etc.) if you want full rebrand consistency.
- Token balance for `stormrobin50@gmail.com` was set to `99999` via DB earlier (dev endpoint exists at `/api/dev/set-tokens`).
