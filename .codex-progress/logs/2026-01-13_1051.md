# 2026-01-13_1051 — Podcast MVP i18n sweep + Orders multi-status filter + numeric pagination

## What changed

- Podcast MVP (`/podcast-mvp`):
  - Voice picker `Language` dropdown: label localized by route locale; language options shown in native/endonym form + region name (and still include BCP-47 code).
  - Voice picker status lines localized: current voice / tier / resolved voice, “found voices” + tier counts, and static-preview fallback copy.
  - Generated History localized: section title, Clear button, retention/quota copy (with template placeholders), delete confirm copy.
  - History item UI localized: “Total duration”, “Loading…”, Download/Delete labels (both card history and table history view).
  - Playback note + “Why might it not feel like 4x?” explanation block localized across locales.
- Orders (`/{locale}/orders`):
  - Status filter supports multi-select (e.g. pending + paid + cancelled) and is placed next to the search input inside the orders list card.
  - Pagination: switched to numeric page links (with ellipsis) using the shared `Pagination` component.
  - Total counts: API total now uses `count(*)`, UI displays “showing X–Y of TOTAL”.
  - API supports `status=pending,paid,cancelled` (comma-separated) in addition to single status.

## Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit` (build can be blocked if `next dev` holds the `.next` lock).
